Building Flashcache :
-------------------
We've built and tested Flashcache on both 2.6.20 and 2.6.18.
If you need help with newer kernels, please send email.
Older than 2.6.18 kernels are not supported.

You'll need the entire kernel source tree in order to build
flashcache.

At the top directory, run

make KERNEL_TREE=<root of the kernel source tree>

This builds both the flashcache.ko and 3 utilities.

flascache-sa-guide.txt has details on how to create and load
flashcache volumes.
