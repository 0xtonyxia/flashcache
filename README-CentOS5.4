Vadim T (Percona) wrote this doc on building Flashcache for CentOS5.4.

Hi,

It took some efforts for make binary on plain CentOS 5.4 with kernel
2.6.18-164.15.1.el5,
so I want to share my notes (If you do not mind I'd like to add it to
INSTALL.CentOS54 or like that)

CentOS 5.4 x86_64
base document is:
http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/I_need_the_Kernel_Source

1. we need to get full source code of kernel.

so:

* as root:

yum install rpm-build redhat-rpm-config unifdef

As an ordinary user, not root, create a directory tree based on ~/
rpmbuild:
[user@host]$ cd
[user@host]$ mkdir -p rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
[user@host]$ echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > .rpmmacros

* install kernel src.rpm
rpm -i http://mirror.centos.org/centos/5/updates/SRPMS/kernel-2.6.18-164.15....
2>&1 | grep -v mockb
cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
rpmbuild -bp --target=`uname -m` kernel-2.6.spec 2> prep-err.log | tee prep-out.log

The kernel source tree will now be found in the directory ~/rpmbuild/
BUILD/.

next commands to prepare kernel:

cd ~/rpmbuild/BUILD/kernel-2.6.18/linux-2.6.18.x86_64
make oldconfig
make prepare
make modules_prepare

Now kernel source code which can be used to build flashcache is there:
~/rpmbuild/BUILD/kernel-2.6.18/linux-2.6.18.x86_64

to build flashcache you use:
make KERNEL_TREE=/home/vadim/rpmbuild/BUILD/kernel-2.6.18/
linux-2.6.18.x86_64/

but you also need to make next changes to
file: src/Makefile
replace EXTRA_CFLAGS line by:
EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I$(KERNEL_TREE)/drivers/md -I$(KERNEL_TREE)/include/
linux  -I./

Thanks,
Vadim
